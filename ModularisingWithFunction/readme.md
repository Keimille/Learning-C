# Creating Modules with Function
- Reduces complexity
- Reduces development time
- Easy to identify bugs
- Easy to update program

## Libray Functions vs. User Defined Functions

### Examples of Library Functions
- scanf()
- printf()
- strlen()
- strcpy

These are all genereal purpose functions. If you would like to developic cleaner and specific program you will want to use User Defined Functions

## User Defined Functions (UDF)

###Requirements/Considerations
- Function name must be unique
- Must have input paramaters
- What is the return value?
    * Return data type must match the data type prefix of function. *
